## ⚠️ Migrating from Python Version

**This repository is the next evolution of the Hikma Health platform**, combining what used to be two separate repositories:

- `hikma-health-backend` (Python & Flask)
- `hikma-health-admin` (JavaScript/TypeScript & Next.js)

Now unified into a single, modern full-stack application built with **TypeScript and TanStack Start**, featuring many new capabilities and improvements.

### Migration Steps

Migration is straightforward and takes just a few minutes:

1. **Deploy the new version**
   - If you previously deployed to Render (as recommended), simply click the "Deploy to Render" button above
   - Render will automatically copy over your existing database configuration
   - The new deployment will use your existing PostgreSQL database
   - Your mobile app users will need to signout and re-scan the QR code

2. **Monitor the deployment**
   - Verify the application runs correctly
   - Test key workflows to ensure everything works as expected
   - The system will automatically run database migrations on startup

3. **Clean up old deployments**
   - After confirming the new system works properly, you can safely delete or archive:
     - Your old `hikma-health-backend` service
     - Your old `hikma-health-admin` service
   - This will free up resources and simplify your infrastructure

**Note**: Your database remains untouched during migration. The new system uses the same PostgreSQL database and automatically updates the schema through migrations.

- **PostgreSQL** (one of the following):
  - Local installation - [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - Remote database (Render, DigitalOcean, Supabase, etc.)
  - Docker container
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: TanStack Start (React-based full-stack framework)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Kysely query builder
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Store, XState
- **Forms**: TanStack Form with React Hook Form
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit tests) + Playwright (E2E tests)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:hikmahealth/hikma-health-server.git
   cd hikma-health-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
   ```

   Replace the connection string with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   pnpm run migrate:latest
   ```

### Running the Project

**Development mode** (with hot reload):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

**Production build**:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Key Directories Explained

- **`src/routes/`** - File-based routing powered by TanStack Router. Each file represents a route in the application.
- **`src/components/`** - Reusable UI components built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **`src/db/`** - Database connection setup, query builders, and Kysely configuration.
- **`db/`** - SQL migration files that define the database schema evolution.
- **`src/models/`** - TypeScript types and interfaces for data structures.
- **`src/stores/`** - Client and server state management using TanStack Store and XState.

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

- **NEVER commit the `.env` file** to version control
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`
- Store sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys) only in `.env`
- Use different `.env` files for development, staging, and production
- In production, use environment variables provided by your hosting platform

### Database Credentials

- Use strong passwords for database accounts
- Restrict database access to specific IP addresses when possible
- Use SSL/TLS connections for remote databases
- Regularly rotate credentials

### General Security

- Keep dependencies up to date: `pnpm update`
- Review security advisories: `pnpm audit`
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal health data)
- Follow HIPAA and local healthcare data regulations
- Use HTTPS in production environments
